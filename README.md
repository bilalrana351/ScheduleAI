# Schedule AI

## Overview
Schedule AI is a project that automatically generates a daily schedule from Natural Language input using Self-Trained Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

## Purpose
The purpose of Scehdule AI is to convert user-provided natural language input into a structured daily schedule using machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- Self-Trained Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)  
- FastAPI (Backend API)  
- React.js (Frontend)  

## Features
- Accepts natural language input describing daily tasks  
- Uses self-trained HMMs to predict and generate an optimized schedule  
- Provides a clean and interactive user interface built with React.js  
- Backend API built with FastAPI
